# DeepScale

A Python library for large-scale deep learning training across thousands of GPUs, designed for training massive models like Large Language Models (LLMs) and other billion-parameter architectures.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install deepscale
```

```python
from deepscale import DistributedTrainer, LLMTrainer

# Train across thousands of GPUs
trainer = DistributedTrainer(model, num_gpus=1000)
effective_batch_size = trainer.calculate_effective_batch_size()

# LLM training at scale
llm_trainer = LLMTrainer(model_size="70B", num_gpus=2048)
```

## Features

- **Massive Scale Training**: Support for training across thousands of GPUs
- **LLM Training**: Specialized utilities for Large Language Model training
- **Distributed Training**: Advanced distributed training strategies
- **Model Parallelism**: Pipeline and tensor parallelism for massive models
- **Memory Optimization**: Techniques for training billion-parameter models
